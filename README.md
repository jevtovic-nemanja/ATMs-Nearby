# ATMs-Nearby

Responsive webapp that takes user current location and displays a list of closest ATMs around.

The Geolocation API was used to procure user location, while Google Maps Javascript API services (Places and Distance Matrix) were used to procure the closest ATMs and their distances from user location. Finally, Google Static Maps API was used to display maps showing the ATMs locations.

The ATMs list can be sorted by distance from user location and filtered to show only Multi-currency ATMs.
